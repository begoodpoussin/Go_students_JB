Then you should move the robot to the case 1 and press again the `button_forward`, to show the result beliefs after the move() function (beliefs are basically shifted to the right). And you can press again the `button_forward` to show the beliefs after a new step of sensing, thanks to the function sense(). Now, the robot show strong beliefs for the positions 1, 5 and 6, as there are positions where we can find two black cases in a row.
